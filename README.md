> 1. Describe the current state of the problem. Use quantitative metrics to demonstrate the importance of solving it.
> 2. Discuss the existing research, listing the most relevant related work and key background readings. Be quantitative, and explain why the current or proposed solutions do not adequately address the problem. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your capacity as a researcher in this field.
> 3. Define your approach to addressing or solving the problem:
> a. Describe the steps you would take to reach a solution. Do not simply describe the end goal. Be technical.
> b. How would you de-risk this research problem? What is the biggest obstacle to ensuring a successful project? For example, if your solution involves combining two technologies, explain how they would work together and what problems would likely need to be solved.
> c. In relation to the problem you are describing, what would define a “successful” research project?
> 4. What limits your ability to solve this problem without Protocol Labs? How do you see Protocol Labs supporting you in pursuit of this project?

Don’t speak in generalities or broad concepts; be technical, specific, and thorough! Assume we will consult experts in relevant fields to evaluate the novelty and potential risks for your proposal.

When it comes to splitting a team between remote and office-based, no matter the ratio, he says that “the challenges remain the same: ineffective communication. As an employer, it’s critical to maintain a community for all workers despite their physical location, and require manager training specific to remote workers as well as provide the latest technological advancements in digital collaboration tools across the organization.”
